-Final Project Phases- 
Recipe Sharing Platform


Week 1: Planning and Setup

We will define the features and functionalities of the Recipe Sharing Platform API, including user authentication, recipe search, recipe upload, and user profile management.
Specify the endpoints that will be implemented to support these features, such as:

Authentication Routes:

/api/auth/register - Register a new user
/api/auth/login - User login
/api/auth/logout - User logout
User Routes:

/api/users/profile - Get user profile
/api/users/update - Update user profile
Recipe Routes:

/api/recipes - Get all recipes
/api/recipes/:id - Get a specific recipe by ID
/api/recipes/create - Create a new recipe
/api/recipes/:id/update - Update a recipe
/api/recipes/:id/delete - Delete a recipe

Week 2: Backend Development

Authentication and Authorization (3 days): Implement user authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with Express.js. Set up middleware to validate user access to API endpoints.
CRUD Operations with MongoDB (2 days): Develop CRUD operations for managing users and recipes using MongoDB with Mongoose. Create endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting user profiles and recipes.
Integration with Edamam API (2 days): Integrate the Edamam API for recipe search functionality. Implement endpoints to fetch recipes based on ingredients and other criteria.

Week 3: Testing, Refinement, and Deployment

Integration Testing (3 days): Perform integration testing to ensure seamless communication between frontend and backend components. Test user authentication, recipe search, recipe upload, and other key features.
Refinement (2 days): Refine the API endpoints, database queries, and user interface based on feedback and testing results. Optimize database queries for better performance and improve the user interface for usability.
Deployment (2 days): Deploy the API to a hosting service such as Heroku or AWS using continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. Set up monitoring and error tracking tools to monitor application performance.
